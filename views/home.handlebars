              and clothing catalogs, and magazines. I've also done TV,  factory advertising, car advertising, and hotel advertising.
               After working in Asia I moved to the United States where I've participated in New York Fashion week, multiple adverts
               and also had some work printed in a Miami magazine. I am Currently signed with EMG models NYC and doing a lot of events and photo shoots
